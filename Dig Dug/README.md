# Project 3: 80â€™s

Screen resolution: 16x9

## Scope
* One stage of the game, made endless so it won't be short.


## Intervention
* Added a power-up to the player that allows him to push rocks in the direction he's facing. He gains energy by taking the drops
and defeating enemies, and then he can push the rocks once he has a full energy bar.


## Mechanics
- Player:
  * Main character can move in 4 directions, top, left, right, and down.
  * The character drills through the sand blocks as he walks.
  * The player can press a button to inflate enemies (they take about 4 hits to die)
  * Killing any enemy awards points, inflating less than dropping a rock.
  * Player has 3 lives, if any enemy hits him he loses one and the stage (except from the blocks) resets.
- Stage:
  * Stage is filled with sand blocks, and 3-4 stones.
  * If a stone falls on an enemy, it will kill the enemy instantly.
  * Score is displayed in the top of the screen with high score near it.
- Enemies:
  * Two types of enemies, one can breath fire on the player.
  * The enemies constantly try to follow the player, if there's a path to him.
  * If there's no path to the player, after a while they take a ghost form which can move through the sand.
  * The last enemy in the stage attempts to escape through the top.
