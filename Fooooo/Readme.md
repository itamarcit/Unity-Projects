* Fine tune of physics to everything.

Feedback given by the faculty
---
* __Player movement control is not comfortable__
  * Solution - changed the control to a different camera and movement control. 
* __Make the game more silly and not serious nor too challenging__
  * Solution - leaves affected by larger radius from the blower so you can blow more leaves in a blow.
* __Make it more forgiving__
  * Solution - when  player is close to the edge it is not sliding out.
* __Reduce the urge to try to move to other islands__
  * Solution - disabled the objects of the other islands when not on it.
* __Make it play only via keyboard__
  * Solution - changed all the control to keyboard.

General reflections
---
Overall, the team worked amazing together, both designers and developers. 
From the developers point of view, we had a great time working together, getting to know each other better and 
solving problems together until the middle of the night. We split the assignments equally and worked a lot together.
The work with the designers was professional and respectful. 
Even though there were disagreements at times, we managed to reach
middle grounds.
Every challenge we faced was conquered by the full team's effort.

Fast restart shortcuts
---
- Pressing X and O together allows you to move to the next stage.
- Pressing Y resets the player's progress and moves you back to the opening scene.
- Pressing P when in the opening scene unlocks all levels and reloads the scene.

Bugs
---
- During the final submission, we encountered a possible bug, we aren't sure if it's actually a bug or if it happened
  due to the games running for a long time on a second monitor.
  Rarely, the loading animation got stuck endlessly when trying to go to the main menu from the game.
