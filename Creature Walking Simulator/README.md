## Explain your design. What did you try to achieve?

Our goal was to create a creature that moved realistically like an animal, 
while also being visually engaging. To achieve this, we focused on several key design elements. 
First, we made sure to move the legs in a side-to-side motion, which closely mimics the gait of many animals. 
Additionally, we added a subtle wiggle to the tail and rotation to the head during movement, 
as well as a slight tilt when the creature is idle, all to make it seem more lively.

We also worked on the creature's overall motion, 
adjusting its body rotation to create smoother transitions when it encountered changes in terrain. 
To further enhance the creature's realism, we included sound effects that matched its movements and behaviors.

Overall, we aimed to create a creature that felt believable and immersive, 
while also having a distinct personality and charm. By focusing on these various design elements, 
we believe we were able to achieve this goal.


## What would you improve given more time?

Given more time, there are a few areas where we would like to further improve the creature's movement 
and animation. One area we would focus on is the rotation of the legs when traversing slopes. 
While having no rotation on the feet is functional, we believe it could be made more dynamic and visually 
interesting by adding some additional tilt and rotation to simulate the creature's weight distribution.

Another area we would like to improve is the creature's ability to rotate in place. 
We would work on creating more natural and believable leg movement to enable the creature to pivot 
and turn smoothly.

Finally, we would also like to enhance the realism of the leg movements by incorporating a 
folding motion at the start of each animation. By simulating how a real animal would position 
its legs before moving, we believe we could create a more authentic and engaging experience for the viewer.







The rotation seems fine but can be improved. 
When going on a slope we could give the body and legs tip some rotation.
Adding a bounce effect to each leg before it goes up (like a spring stretching before giving out).
