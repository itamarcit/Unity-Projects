Difficulties in the Exercise:
1. It was challenging to decide which parts we needed to give up and which parts we wanted to keep.

2. It was challenging to work with a new group of people in a short amount of time.

3. Rect transform and partice system, lack of sufficient prior knowledge led to >:(
 
Feedback, Implementation and Playtest:

1. Player speed, lots of playtests to achive the right speed.

2. The need to add tutorial.

3. Change the light.

4. To think if we need to change the mirror sides or keep them fixed.
