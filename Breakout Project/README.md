# Project 2: Breakout

Screen resolution: Full HD (1920x1080)

In order to play the game, please load the scene called "Opening Scene". The keys for the game are space and the arrows.

My mechanic interventions are:
- Adding an arrow mechanic so that the initial direction of the ball is determined by the player
- Added story driven mechanics to the game (the keys and shooting them at the locks)

GDD mechanics I changed/replaced/removed:
- When starting the game, a rotating arrow will be shown, and the player will press space when the arrow reached the desired 
  direction for the ball to start
- There's no middle row so the ball will not speed up when hitting a brick from the middle row
- When winning, there is no paddle shown in the screen
- In order to win, you need to finish all stages and rescue the princess by breaking her out of prison
